      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tag above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

    <h1>About!</h1>

    <p>Hey I have not made a pretty about page yet because I am lazy!</p>

    <p>Like all talk show fans I have an allegiance to my favorite hosts (Letterman), but when it comes time for the musical performances I don't care which show I watch. I turn on the show with the best band for the last five minutes. This website is to help late night talk show fans like myself explore the musical guest lineup and decide which program to tune-in to for that last five minutes. Enjoy!</p>

    <p>Let me know what you think about this little website thing by sending an email to oldscarflabs@gmail.com and I will for sure get back to you.</p>

    <p>More features to come (like an actual about page)</p>
